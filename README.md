# My Commandline Interface

A Rust-based commandline interface made with a component architecture using [ratatui](https://ratatui.rs/) for its display.
This interface was made as a tool to ease the interactions with my website's database, specifically with the upkeep of pages in its navigation bar.

## Current Features

Currently the interface features:

- Strong customisability for actions on pre-defined tables
- Addition of rows to pre-defined tables
- Deletion of rows to pre-defined tables
- Modification of a cell within a pre-defined table
